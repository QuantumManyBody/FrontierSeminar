            <p id="abstract">The specification of baseline features (BFs) is a crucial step in the design of clinical trials (CTs) as they are critical for ensuring the validity of the results. We introduce CTSuggest, an app leveraging LLMs to generate BFs as part of the CT design process. Users specify trial metadata, then&nbsp;CTSuggest suggests features with explanations. Users can create an entirely new trial or use an existing trial. We validate the quality of CTSuggest’s BFs using the CT-Pub dataset and evaluating using an LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ)&nbsp;framework. Feature suggestions generated by the GPT-4o model meet or exceed the previously published CTBench results. Additionally, we examine the&nbsp;reliability of LaaJ evaluation within this setting. Coherence checking revealed hallucinations in the LaaJ’s evaluation, necessitating a&nbsp;postprocessing correction step that yielded more accurate performance metrics. Three different hallucination types were observed. The hallucination rate provides a quantifiable coherence metric that can be used to improve LaaJ reliability.</p>
