            <p id="abstract">The
                                    specification of potentially confounding
                                    baseline features or covariates is a
                                    crucial step in the design of prospective
                                    and retrospective clinical trials. Baseline
                                    features are critical for ensuring the
                                    integrity of the study design, the validity
                                    of the results, and the generalizability of
                                    the findings. We introduce CTSuggest, an
                                    application leveraging large language
                                    models (LLMs) to generate baseline features
                                    as part of the clinical trial design
                                    process. Users first specify basic trial
                                    metadata, and then CTSuggest suggests
                                    appropriate features with an explanation
                                    for each feature. Users can create an
                                    entirely new trial or start with metadata
                                    from an existing trial from
                                    ClinicalTrials.gov. We perform experiments
                                    validating the quality of CTSuggest’s
                                    baseline features using the benchmark
                                    CT-Pub dataset taken from clinical trial
                                    publications and evaluating using the
                                    “LLM-as-a-Judge” (LaaJ) framework provided
                                    in the CTBench benchmark. The results show
                                    that the feature suggestions generated by
                                    the state-of-the-art GPT-4o model meet or
                                    exceed the previously published CTBench
                                    results. We also show the promise of using
                                    a smaller open-source Llama model.
                                    Additionally, we examine the reliability of
                                    LaaJ evaluation within this setting.
                                    Coherence checking revealed hallucinations
                                    in the LaaJ’s evaluation, necessitating a
                                    postprocessing correction step that yielded
                                    lower but more accurate performance
                                    metrics. Three different types of
                                    hallucination were observed. The
                                    hallucination rate provides a quantifiable
                                    coherence metric that can be systematically
                                    used to improve LaaJ reliability. Our
                                    findings underscore the challenges in
                                    developing reliable LLM evaluation methods
                                    in healthcare applications and demonstrate
                                    a potential framework for improving LaaJ
                                    systems.</p>
