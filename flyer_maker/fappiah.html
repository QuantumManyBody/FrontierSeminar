            <p id="abstract">We develop and analyze a new approach for simultaneously computing multiple solutions to the Helmholtz
                                    equation for different frequencies and different forcing functions. The new Multi-Frequency WaveHoltz
                                    (MFWH) algorithm is an extension of the original WaveHoltz method and both are based on time-filtering
                                    solutions to an associated wave-equation. With MFWH, the different Helmholtz solutions are computed
                                    simultaneously by solving a single wave equation combined with multiple time filters. The MFWH algorithm
                                    defines a fixed-point iteration which can be accelerated with Krylov methods such as GMRES. The solution
                                    of the wave equation can be efficiently solved with implicit time-stepping using as few as five time-steps per
                                    period. Discretization errors in time can be completely removed by various adjustments. Numerical results
                                    are given to confirm the convergence theory when solving energy conserving problems.
