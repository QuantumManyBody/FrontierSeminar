            <p id="abstract">Quantum Dynamical Phase Transitions (DPTs) are a framework to understand how quantum systems evolve over time. Due to the high circuit depth needed for accurate time evolution of large-scale quantum systems on digital quantum computers, DPTs have been mostly investigated on analog quantum simulators (ex: trapped-ion) on large 1D systems and small 2D systems. Utilizing the lower circuit depth provided by fractional-gate equipped IBM quantum computers, we realize DPTs by applying quantum quenches of large 2D Transverse Field Ising Models with hardware-native geometry. Experimental results on real quantum hardware demonstrate that fractional gates outperform standard basis gates and DPTs can be realized for 2D systems. Note: All necessary background knowledge will be built up, so anyone that is interested in quantum computing is invited to attend. </p>
