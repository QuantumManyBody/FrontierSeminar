            <p id="abstract">Renewable power generators typically participate as
                price-takers in current electricity markets, and market clearing
                prices are determined by cost curves of conventional generators
                while treating renewable generation as negative load. In this
                paper, we analyze a new design of electricity markets where
                renewable power generators are able to bid their expectation-
                adjusted cost curves into the market, just like the cost curves
                of conventional generators. We formally define the new market
                model, and mathematically show how the renewable cost curves
                should be determined for the new market to be equivalent
                to the current market in terms of overall system cost. We
                further establish that on the average, the total revenue of both
                conventional and renewable generators, as well as the total cost
                to consumers, under the proposed market is the same as the
                current practice. While equivalent in terms of aggregate cost and
                revenue measures, the new market design allows renewables to
                be direct participants in the bidding process and bid according to
                their risk-return tolerance. We demonstrate our analytical results
                numerically using data obtained from the the Texas grid.
                Index Termsâ€”renewable bidders, expectation-adjusted cost
                curves, stochastic unit commitment.</p>
